Stress Meter

The link between the measurements and stress is straightforward. When you are nervous, your heart rate increases, to provide more blood flow and to be more alert, and the palms start sweating. By using sensors designed for measuring the change in these parameters, we can calculate stress and implement it in the game. The information displayed is on a I2C LCD screen. Morse code library is used for the game.
